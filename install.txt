IIS Setup:
build the Listener solution;
copy the bin files to the client box, e.g. C:\aTest\Appstore.Web\bin;
Create a new Web Site in IIS called ‘IPNListener”
Set the Physical path to IPNListener(C:\aTest\Appstore.Web);
In  the Application Pools, make sure IPNListener .Net framework is set to v4.0.
Make sure all needed components (eg: ASP.NET, and mvc3) are installed in "Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows features on or off -> Internet Information Services".
The server may report fail to find "default.aspx" if ASP.Net is not registered correct in IIS. Had to run the following command in the command line/run
